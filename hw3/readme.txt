XQueries:
1. Find the names of all departments that house a division in which an employee named “PSmith” or “Jack” works for at least 50% time.
2. Find names of divisions that EVERY employee works for.
3. Find names of the departments that house at least one division managed by “PSmith” but no divisions managed by “Wong”.
4. Find employees who do not manage any division in the company. Display their names, phone numbers, and offices, ordered by name in descending order.
5. Find the average number of divisions that each employee works for. (E.g.: if the company has 2 employees, with emp1 working for 4 divisions and emp2 working for 3 divisions, then the average number of divisions = (4+3)/2 = 3.5)
6. Find the name, phone, and office of the employee who works for the maximum number of divisions.
